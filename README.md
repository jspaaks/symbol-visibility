# symbol-visibility

## CMake

The project has been initialized with a [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)-based
configuration for building with CMake:

```console
# change into the build directory
$ cd build/

# generate the build files
$ cmake ..

# build the project
$ cmake --build .

# install the project to <repo>/build/dist
$ cmake --install .

# run the program to see if it works
$ ./dist/bin/calculator
```

Should output something like:

```text
-- test compile definitions
   DEBUG compile definition has been defined.

-- test wether math library was linked
   sqrt(144) = 12.000000

-- test c2x / c23 features
   0 1 2 3 4

-- test own library
   divide(2, 3) = 0
   multiply(2, 3) = 6

```
